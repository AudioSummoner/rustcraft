## Building from source

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you need to have the following installed:

- **Rust** (Stable toolchain) (This can be installed in several ways depending on your setup, the most standard way is to use rustup.rs.)
- **Make**


### Running the Project

To compile and run the game locally, use the following commands:

Note: the first compilation will be slow depending on your hardware, next compilations will be incremental and thus faster.

```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/c2i-junia/minecraft-rust

# Navigate to the project directory
cd minecraft-rust

# Build the project in debug or release mode
make debug    # or `make release`

# Run the executable
./minecraft-rust/bin/minecraft-rust
```

## Contributing

Feel free to submit issues or open pull requests. If you want to know where to help, refer to the existing issues.

### Guidelines 

1. Run `cargo fmt` before committing.
2. **Commit Messages**:
   - Use a capitalized first letter.
   - Write commit messages in the present tense (e.g., "Add feature X" instead of "Added feature X").
3. **Branches**:
   - Use the naming convention `feature/<description>` for branches introducing new features.
   - The `main` branch should always compile successfully and be free of warnings.
   - Experimental branches are allowed to include code that does not build successfully.
   - Prefer rebasing over merging.
